I usually dont like podcasts that much. Seems to me like something for people with too much free time on their hands. Ive listened to a few in the past, like the Inside Mac Radio Podcast, which was pretty much useless. But now ive started listening to the Chaosradio Podcast, which has been very active the past few weeks, thanks to the upcoming Chaos Communication Congress. The cool thing is that you can plug in your earphones, listen to Tim and Guests talk about the Congress Program and hack away while listening. You can check it out at <http://chaosradio.ccc.de/empfang.html>, even without using iTunes. Its german though, but maybe its that time of the year to learn a new foreign language :P

Btw, for the German users: The ARD has a daily Videocast of the 8 o&#8217;clock news &#8220;Tagesschau&#8221;. For nerds like me who dont own a tv and dont like to be bound to specific air dates this is pretty cool ;)

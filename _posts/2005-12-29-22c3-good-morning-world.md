[<img data-echo="https://static.flickr.com/39/78891438_95449a8c22_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="DSC00603" class="alignleft" />](https://secure.flickr.com/photos/heipei/tags/22c3/ "Photo Sharing")Yes, the forecast was accurate. We have about 10cm of fresh snow here, and it doesnt look like stopping at the moment. I just woke up from a somewhat uncomfortable night in the Hackcenter, and still didnt have breakfast, so thats my priority right now ;).
  
I hope I wont forget to watch some lectures today. Especially fd0&#8217;s talk on Atmel for Dummies.
  
&#8220;Use more bandwidth&#8221; still seems to be the motto around here, but Flo and I have all our HDDs (local and remote) already completely used, so we have to count on people from the outside to generate some traffic. Please dont leave us with the shame of not exausting the uplink.

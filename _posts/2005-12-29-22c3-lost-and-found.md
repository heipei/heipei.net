I didnt think it would happen, but when i checked half an hour someone had really returned my wallet to the Lost and Found counter. It had been found outside the congress center, the money of course gone. Funny, the thief even took the 1-dollar note which was there purely for decorational purposes.
  
Anyway, congress is moving along, the CTF is still taking place (!eof ranked last while we were there). We moved to a more comfortable spot, we have a table, two couches and still no stable internet (which is our fault, you should see the Discordian Cable Management here). Flo is doing everything to respect the wish of the Infotresen which was printed everywere in Huge Letter &#8220;Use more bandwidth&#8221;. Seems that there are to few people here to really make us of our 16Gbit/s internet uplink, or that the people here have better things to do than leech all the time (or simply that everything you could ask for is available in the internal network so there is no need for downloading from the outside world). Hmm, i should really upload some more photos&#8230;

Although a lot of things have been going more than wrong in the last few weeks there is one thing which went the right way. Since I dont really have time at the moment and havent brought my thoughts and what I am going to write in the right order yet im just asking you to stay put. I will probably write a lengthier article during the next week about my newest project (yep, thats the exact term). Lets just say that it stopped my previous complaining about the lack of hacking linux on some exotic hardware (although that post was in german i think ;).

Right now those would be:

  * This weblog&#8217;s theme
  * Firefox 2 crashing every 10 minutes (like in the middle of this very sentence, i suspect the flash player plugin)
  * People trying to convince other people that Macs are great (im through with that, at least from the software point of view)
  * The weather being freezing cold

Ive found out what&#8217;s been causing my Firefox 2.0 crashes. It was the really helpful &#8220;Session Manager&#8221; Add-On, which hasnt been converted to Firefox 2.0 yet. I hope it will be soon.

Anyway, ive a handful of different add-ons which id like to share with y&#8217;all:

  * [Hit-A-Hint](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1341/) which enables you to browse pages and links only using your keyboard
  * del.icio.us plugin for bookmarking, not much to say here ;)
  * [Fission](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1951/) which is a status-bar in your address-bar. This way you can switch of your statusbar at the bottom and save some precious pixels.

Also AdBlock Plus and DownloadThemAll are cool, but i dont really use them anymore. Well, go try yourself ;)

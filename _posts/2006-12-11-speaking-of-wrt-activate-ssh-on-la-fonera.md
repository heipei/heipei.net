Today i tried out something i found yesterday. I activated SSH access on my La Fonera access point. Since the first method didnt work for me partout (and then was fixed) i was desperate to find another way. Well, have a look at the simple howto over at <http://bingobommel.blogspot.com/> for activating it on your fonera. The important thing: **DONT** connect your fonera to the internet, as it might download updates from fon and close the hole which this method uses.
  
I still have to figure out what exactly to do with the ssh access, but i can think of a few things&#8230; ;)

[<img data-echo="/weblog/git-cheat-sheet.jpg" alt="git cheat sheet" class="alignleft" />](http://ktown.kde.org/~zrusin/git/)Git 1.5.3 was &#8220;released&#8221; yesterday by Junio. You can get it via your favorite package manager (it&#8217;s still keyworded on amd64/gentoo though) or via [git](http://repo.or.cz/w/git.git/) of course. I&#8217;m not really that much into the whole development process and also do not have a project to use git with (although that will change soon), but I am still busy trying to figure it out and having fun with it. One new cool thing in 1.5.3 is git-stash which stashes away what you are currently working on to give you the ability to change something about the so-far-committed work, and after that go back to what you were hacking at before.

Also someone on the git-ml created a nifty-looking cheat-sheet for git (those cheat-sheets seem to be all the hype nowadays) which you can download by clicking the image in this post. It is really helpful for beginners, not just only to reference to about the commands but also to get an understanding of the workflow.

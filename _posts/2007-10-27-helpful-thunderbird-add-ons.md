I am usually not that big a fan of add-ons, plugins etc., for the simple reason that I really hate having to collect them from different websites only to get the program I want running and having to repeat all that every time i switch to another computer. But for some plugins the gain in productivity outweighs the extra effort downloading them. For Thunderbird the add-ons I can recommend are:

  * [Enigmail](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/71), which gives you gnupg integration for Thunderbird
  * [External Editor](http://globs.org/download.php?lng=en), which allows you to compose mails with your favorite editor (think (g)vim).
  * [Colored Diffs](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/4268), which is a must-have if you read mailinglists where patches are posted.

The last plugin is especially cool, since it allows you to read patches much easier than in the raw format.

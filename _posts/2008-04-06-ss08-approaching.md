<img class="alignleft" src="/weblog/rwth-logo.gif" alt="RWTH" />The next semester is approaching (in fact: it starts tomorrow). I just recently finished all my exams for the last semester and was really happy with the 4 days of not having to worry about learning for the next one ;). Anyway, I&#8217;m glad the lectures start again since I&#8217;ll have much more freedom now regarding which lectures I&#8217;d like to attend/be tested in and also when to take the exams (which for students of CS are oral exams).
  
Another reason for this entry is that I wanted to test the new WordPress 2.5 Admin-Interface. It&#8217;s quite different but I think I&#8217;ll get used to it. Also I installed a plugin called  [&#8220;WassUp&#8221;](http://www.wpwp.org/) which gives you a rough overview over your site&#8217;s visitors (if, like me, you don&#8217;t have access to the apache logs).

<img src="/weblog/git-logo.png" class="alignleft" alt="git" />As you can imagine I have been using git some more since the last post about it (and I&#8217;ve even been giving GitHub some more thorough investigation, but I&#8217;ll be posting about that later). Back then I already understood most of it (definetely enough to work with it), but just recently I got the feeling of really understanding git, especially the underlying data-structures and the consequences for the (power)-user.
  
The things that helped me were (besides the git manual which is good, but not graphical, and when it comes to the understanding of the data-structures, having little graphics is a must):

  * [Git from bottom up](http://www.newartisans.com/blog_files/git.from.bottom.up.php), a cool PDF i discovered on the git-wiki.
  * [The RailsConf-Talk by Scott Chacon](http://jointheconversation.org/2008/06/02/railsconf-git-talk/), who also wrote the PeepCode Git PDF (which I haven&#8217;t read due to lack of interest and credit-card). The link points to a video and the slides can also be downloaded as PDF (they are pretty self-explanatory imho).
  * [Git Magic](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~blynn/gitmagic/), which is a cool guide and pretty well structured.

And for the people who are really into screencasts there is also

  * [gitcasts.com](http://www.gitcasts.com/), which too is made by Scott Chacon

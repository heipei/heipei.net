Speedcubing is something that has been gaining considerable popularity over the last 2 years. Just recently Pro7, a big TV station in Germany, did a short piece ([Part 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SkVJv7SZtM), [Part 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBzyJ4mBU-4)) (between &#8220;how to open a bra&#8221; and &#8220;how not to get a cold&#8221;) about [fw](http://hackvalue.de) and a few friends of him, calling him the &#8220;Keimzelle&#8221; (the one who got it all rolling) of Speedcubing in Aachen.
  
So, with a big number of people already Speedcubing in Aachen, and a very open and nerdy community of students, a Speedcubing competition in Aachen was bound to happen sooner or later. In January of next year it will, and it&#8217;s called [&#8220;Aachen Open 2009&#8221;](http://aachen.speedcubing.com/). I&#8217;ll leave the details to the website, but rest-assured this is not just a little private get-together, but as official as it gets (they have WCA-delegates) and the orga-team would like to see new faces, be it people already proficient or just starting out. I&#8217;m also gonna be there (doing my painful 2-3min. &#8220;solve&#8221; of the 3&#215;3&#215;3 ;), so you know there&#8217;s gonna be someone who will suck more than you! ;)
  
You can sign up for the event until the day it starts, but it would be a lot easier on planning if you did it as soon as possible.

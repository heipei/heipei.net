When I was younger I hated the summer (or let&#8217;s say I preferred winter). That was because in winter you had a reasonable explanation why you would sit in front of your PC all day long instead of going outside to play with the other kids or generally to &#8220;get some fresh air&#8221;. Now that I don&#8217;t have to explain myself to anyone anymore and that I&#8217;m bound to a desk by my studies and my work (and my hobbies as well) I can&#8217;t wait to prescribe myself a lot of fresh air. Having said that I&#8217;ll post a few pictures (the sky may already be blue, but don&#8217;t let that fool you) for those of you who couldn&#8217;t make anything of the last few posts here ;)

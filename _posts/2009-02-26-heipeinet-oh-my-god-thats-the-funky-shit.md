Yeah, you read correctly. As of right now, this website can be reached via [heipei.net](https://heipei.net) again.
  
For those of you who haven&#8217;t been reading this weblog 2 years ago: The domain heipei.net [was snatched from me in September &#8217;06](https://heipei.net/2006/09/14/bye-bye-heipeinet/). This of course happened to same part due to sloppiness when trying to move the domain (I can&#8217;t even recall the details). I have been monitoring the domain since then, and had discovered that the domain started expiring at the end of last year. After a 75-day redemption-period it was finally deleted, and I was able to register it (with no backorder or extra-charge).

Although most people know my weblog by now, I suspect a fair share of them has problems memorizing hackvalue.de/heipei/. And I think I&#8217;ll still be getting mail addressed to heipei(Ã¤t)heipei.net (at least spam :P). So, starting today, you can also reach me via
  
<img data-echo="/weblog/heipei_net.png" alt="heipei.net" class="aligncenter" />
  
Please update any links on your websites/weblogs. The whole site can still be reached using the hackvalue.de/heipei/-prefix, but I&#8217;d prefer it if you referred to this domain directly.

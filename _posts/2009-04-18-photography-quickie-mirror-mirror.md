Trying to take a shot of my new cell-phone (after all it&#8217;s raining today so there&#8217;s nothing to photograph on the other side of my window), I lacked sufficient natural lighting and the few lamps in my room don&#8217;t amount to much when it comes to object photography. A flash is the only logical choice in this situation. Since I still have no external flash which can be oriented and covered/diffused easily I&#8217;m still relying on the builtin-flash of the 400D. Flashing something (shiny) head-on gives really ugly shadows and reflections, as we all know. It also makes for skin that looks like it was soaked in a jar of butter. So, I had the really simple idea of reflecting the flash towards the ceiling, where it can bounce back and scatter. I used a small mirror at an angle of about 45 degrees. This only works indoors and with a bright ceiling which isn&#8217;t too far away from the flash (1-3m is OK I suppose). Now for the juicy images ;)

Notice the shadows (or lack thereof) around the phone in the shots.

People which look greasy on photos (which is everyone) will be happy to see that it doesn&#8217;t have to be like that. I also like how the second image has more depth than the first, which looks &#8220;flat&#8221; from the lack of natural shadows (where the light-source usually is above the object).

Please take note that both of these shots were more than insufficiently lit without a flash, so the natural-looking light distribution can almost completely be attributed to the flash.

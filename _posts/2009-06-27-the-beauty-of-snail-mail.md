My [GitHub Octocat sticker](http://github.com/blog/369-get-your-github-stickers) arrived yesterday. I had almost forgotten about it, so it was an even nicer surprise to find a letter from Redwood City, CA in my mailbox today. I asked for the sticker on March 4 this year, quite some time ago ;)
  
I have to say that it&#8217;s really nice to see that these guys didn&#8217;t back away from sending one tiny sticker cross-atlantic in a hand-labeled envelope. Cool thing!

To be more precise I&#8217;m in Pleneuf/Val-Andre in the Bretagne (which in turn belongs to France). The internet-connection was and remains sketchy, so don&#8217;t expect me to answer any emails on time. Katrin also brought her camera (minuscule in comparison to mine ;) and you can view her impressions [on her Flickr-photostream](https://secure.flickr.com/photos/diekatrin/).
  
Besides enjoying the food, the wine and the general attitude of the french towards life I&#8217;ve also been working on GitX a little bit. I&#8217;m hoping that we can release it soonish, but rest-assured the new features will make up for the long wait. Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard beat us to the punch, and I already ordered it.

[<img data-echo="/weblog/256colors_page.png" alt="256 colors Linux" class="aligncenter" />](https://heipei.net/linux/)My weblog is littered with widespread tips about configuration for common shell tools and I post the occasional screenshot to flickr just to show off. I often get mails/comments regarding the used colorschemes and configs, so I thought it would be a good idea to create [a separate page](https://heipei.net/linux/) for these configs (and to keep that up-to-date).

Comments and improvements can be directed to me via email or as a comment to this post.

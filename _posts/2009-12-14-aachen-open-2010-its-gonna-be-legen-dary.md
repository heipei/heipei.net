This is just a reminder that [Aachen Open](http://cube.hackvalue.de/ao10/), a German speedcubing competition, will take place again next year. More precisely on **January 16/17, 2010**. What&#8217;s even better is the huge number of registered participants and the new venue for the competition. Since the last place became quite crowded (and began to smell after about 2 hours) the management secured a larger spot in RWTHs Computer-Science building (Aula II, Ahornstra√üe 55). The downside for visitors is the distance to downtown Aachen, but on the bright side we&#8217;ll be equipped with internet throughout the competition.

Rest assured, I&#8217;ll be there, but probably less cubing and more photographing. So be sure to come by, even if just to get a glimpse of hardcore-nerds in a different area than your own profession. In case you missed the last Aachen Open, be sure to check out [last years website](http://cube.hackvalue.de/ao09/) for impressions.

[<img data-echo="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2787/4265421855_c0e825d5e4_m.jpg" width="160" height="240" alt="Canon 430EX II" class="alignleft" />](https://secure.flickr.com/photos/heipei/4265421855/ "Canon 430EX II by heipei, on Flickr")Wow, the last few weeks I shot more photos (and learned more) than in a whole year, at least that&#8217;s how it feels.
  
First and foremost I got a new lens for my birthday. The Canon EF-S 18-200mm 3.5-5.6 IS. This was meant as a replacement for the rather basic 18-55mm that came with my 400D body. So far the 18-200 hasn&#8217;t disappointed me. I&#8217;m really using the big span of the focal length and since it is meant as my alround-lens I didn&#8217;t care to much about the 3.5 open aperture (I&#8217;ll mostly use it for trips or well-lit situations, my EF 50mm 1.4USM is still the basement-party weapon). Check out a few of my photos on flickr to get an idea of the lens. The IS is really nice, the handling feels rich. The only downsides of this lens are it&#8217;s weight and the autofocus which sometimes has a hard time in low light conditions.

A few weeks ago I decided to finally buy a flash. I didn&#8217;t hesitate long and bought the Canon 430EX II. Before that (and while waiting for DHL) I read a lot of [strobist.com](http://www.strobist.blogspot.com/), so that I hit the ground running when the flash did arrive. The nice thing about buying flashes is that you don&#8217;t have to worry so much about capabilities/size, because you can buy a bigger one which can act as master at some point in the future should you feel the need to. Along with the flash I ordered some small utilities, like the Phottix Tetra radio-triggers for off-camera flash, the Roscoe Strobist Gel collection (gel from &#8220;gelatine&#8221;. It&#8217;s called &#8220;Effektfolien&#8221; in german) and a small diffuser (just for fun). The Phottix Tetra have been great as well, especially considering the price-tag of about 30â‚¬, which is next to nil compared to other wireless triggers which quickly add up to ten times that much. However the Phottix triggers don&#8217;t support TTL, which is a measuring-system so the camera knows how to adjust for the flash. Well, what better time to really get acquainted with the M mode ;)

Aachen Open 2010, which just ended today, was the only real event I looked forward to, photography-wise, and it turned out really nice. Not only was the event itself a smashing success (no other way to put it, the organisation was flawless, the attendance was record-breaking and the venue perfect for our needs), but also meant many diverse personalities to photograph. You can see my complete photos of the event here: [photos.heipei.net/Aachen\_Open\_2010/](http://photos.heipei.net/Aachen_Open_2010/) and photos by other people will be collected here: <http://cube.hackvalue.de/ao10/media-de>.

Tonight I salvaged an old (and broken) Umbrella and simply covered the inside with white xerox paper. I sawed of the round part of the handle and now it fits into the grip of my tripod. The Phottix has a mount option for standard tripods. The [results are amazing](https://secure.flickr.com/photos/heipei/tags/umbrella/), and as usual I now feel much better when I buy an umbrella (I&#8217;m not quite sure whether I want reflective or shoot-through or both ;)

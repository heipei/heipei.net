Believe it or not, this photo was taken about 2km from my parents home, from the dam of the Eschbachtalsperre, a dam for providing the region with drinking water. Usually I just jog around the lake in the morning, but last weekend Katrin and I discovered one of multiple hiking routes around it and the surrounding area. The trails all start at the parking lot and are clearly marked along the way.

I uploaded this shot [along with other shots to flickr](https://secure.flickr.com/photos/heipei/archives/date-taken/2010/05/23/detail/), but then decided to go back and give it a little more depth in Gimp (using Contrast/Saturation, Sharpen, a Tone-Mapping plugin and a gradient for the sky).

Fall in Germany (and especially in Aachen) is something I&#8217;ve learned to enjoy a lot. Even though the days are growing shorter and colder, the golden leafs set the mood for the season to come. I recently shot some photos on the Lousberg and liked some of them enough to make them into a wallpaper for my laptop this winter.

I finally found time to rewrite a large chunk of my old and ever-evolving WordPress template. My goal was to strip as much meta-information and meaningless links from the site as possible. With the space gained by removing things like the sidebar, or the arbitrary fixed width of the content container I was hoping to put more focus on the main content of this blog: My photos.

I have already adjusted the last post to use bigger images from flickr and I will eventually go back and try to edit some older posts as well. I hope you like the new look!

I&#8217;m still busy editing the shots from our recent vacation which we spent on the US East Coast. But we also managed to sneak in a long weekend in Paris this year. Like [the last time around](https://heipei.net/2012/12/18/streets-of-paris/), these three days in Paris were magical, and I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll ever get tired of visiting.

Surprisingly, this time was completely different than when we went there two years ago. Last time it was August, most of the Parisiens apparently had left the city in a mass exodus during the summer vacation in France. This time, unintentionally, we went to Paris in June, and got to see a completely different side of the capital. Where we had been alone before, wandering the streets, taking in the city, we were now sorrounded by scores of people. Not just tourists, but most of the time by Parisiens.

Since we didn&#8217;t anticipate the big difference between June and August, we had decided to go with an apartment &#8220;downtown&#8221; this time, two blocks from the Louvre. This by itself certainly had it perks (and was affordable too, thanks to AirBNB), but since we took our trusty old Volvo (much cheaper than the train, sadly), we actually had to drive straight through the nightmare that is downtown Paris during rush hour.

I&#8217;ll leave the rest of this post for the wonderful photos I managed to capture. Interestingly, we didn&#8217;t see or do many things which we hadn&#8217;t already seen before, but just revisiting the same Quartiers and streets was worth our stay. The only thing we definitely did this time was to go up on the Arc de Triomphe, something we didn&#8217;t know was possible last time around.

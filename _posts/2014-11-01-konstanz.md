Katrin and I went to Konstanz for a weekend in early September. Konstanz is located at the Bodensee, and it was our first time there. It&#8217;s worth a visit, but after two days you&#8217;ve definitely seen everything. You can view [a few of my shots on flickr](https://secure.flickr.com/search/?tags=konstanz&sort=date-posted-desc&user_id=97859317%40N00).

As you might have guessed by watching my [flickr feed in the last few days](https://www.flickr.com/search/?safe_search=3&content_type=1&media=all&user_id=97859317%40N00&min_taken_date=1411171200&max_taken_date=1413158400&adv=1&sort=date-posted-desc), Katrin and I had a vacation on the US East Coast this year. I&#8217;ll do a post about our time there once I&#8217;m done uploading all of the photos, for now just the link to flickr.

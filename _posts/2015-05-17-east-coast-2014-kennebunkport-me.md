Our vacation was almost over, but we still had to get back to NYC for our flight back. Driving straight from Acadia to NYC would have taken too long so we booked a hotel near the town of Kennebunkport, Maine. Kennebunkport is known for the summer home of the Bush family, which is why it was on our radar.

We arrived late so we only took a stroll through the small city centre. For dinner we picked a nice restaurant located near the harbor. The next morning we left for NYC, [which I already wrote about in my first post](https://heipei.net/2015/03/21/east-coast-2014-nyc/).

It&#8217;s been quiet here since my last post on Belgium. Actually, I&#8217;ve been busy uploading the photos from our 2015 vacation to Greece. Our trip to Greece was, once again, something very unique which we&#8217;ll remember for a long time to come. So stay tuned and [follow me on flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/heipei/) for new photos until the next post comes along.

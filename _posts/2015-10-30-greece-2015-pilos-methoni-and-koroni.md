The day was far from over when we left the wonderful Polilimnio Waterfalls. We drove straight west until we reached the coast and the town of Pilos. In Pilos we parked our car at the pier and walked around the central square to finally get a coffee and some ice cream. With its central square and the small restaurants surrounding it, Pilos is the kind of town I think of whenever I remember our vacations in Greece when I was a child.

After Pilos we drove to Methoni, a sleepy tiny town with a formidable citadel. We parked the car somewhere near the entrance of the citadel and started strolling around its huge defensive walls. After a few hundred meters we were almost ready to turn around and go back when we came upon the most serene beach we had seen in Greece. Although we had done plenty of swimming already that day it only took us a few minutes to get back to the car and get changed again. The beach was wide and very shallow, so one could just walk for hundreds of meters while still being able to reach the ground.

The last stop that day was the tiny town of Koroni. It might not have been much smaller than Methoni, but the street to the harbor was a lot more narrow and went straight through the central square in Koroni. There is really not much more to say on Koroni or the other places. We drove back to Kalamata for our last night before leaving for Nafplio.

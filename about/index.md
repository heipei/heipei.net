Hi and welcome to my personal blog. By now it&#8217;s mostly photography-related posts since I started blogging my nerdy stuff on [my dedicated Github-blog.](https://heipei.github.io/) 

As you can see, photography is one my biggest passions. I also enjoy traveling, cycling, blogging and programming. I like to obsess over web-design every now and then and usually take it out on this very blog.

Check out the <a href="/archive/">archive</a> for old posts.

More information to follow soon ;)
